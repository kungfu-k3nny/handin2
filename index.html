        <h1>A/B Testing</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>I ran a simple A/B test on two different UI designs and analyzed the results. From these results, we drew conclusions on whether a design choice could have reasonably impacted user interaction.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Part 1: Data Collection</h2>
        <p>I ran an A/B test on a simple webpage that is responsible for scheduling appointments with a medical practitioner.</p>
        <p>The target interaction was to schedule an appointment, and the measured metrics were:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>time spent on page</li>
            <li>time before the user first clicks</li>
            <li>total distance the cursor moves</li>
            <li>number of clicks</li>
            <li>whether or not the user misclicked</li>
            <li>whether or not the user succeeded in scheduling the appointment</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The orignal webpage looked like this</p>
        <img alt="webpage A" src="./assets/a_ss.png"/>
        <p>And my updated webpage looked like this</p>
        <img alt="webpage B" src="./assets/b_ss.png"/>
    </section>

        <h2>Part 2: Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Creating Hypotheses</h3>
        <p>There are three metrics that we are using to determine whether or not
            my design choices reasonably impacted user interaction: Time spent on
            page, misclick rate, and total distance of cursor movement. Below, I
            dive into the details of why I used these metrics, the null
            and alternative hypotheses for each of the metrics, and the reasoning
            behind choosing these hypotheses.</p>
        <ol>
            <h4><li>Time spent on page</li></h4>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>More time spent on the page indicates a user confusion</li>
                <li>The null hypothesis is that users spend the same amount of 
                    time on webpage A as they spend on webpage B</li>
                <li>The alternative hypothesis is that users spend more time on
                    webpage A than they spend on webpage B</li>
                <li>I believe that the null hypotheses will be rejected because
                    webpage A has low color contrast in their buttons, their
                    appointments are not ordered by calendar, and buttons of
                    different functionalities appear the same. All of these 
                    reasons combined may cause the user to take a longer time 
                    to search for the appointment slot they are looking for
                </li>
                <li>The reasoning for this alternative hypothesis is that
                    webpage B's increased color contrast, ordering of appointments
                    by calendar, and side-by-side button layout, and differing
                    button colors that depend on functionality could aid the user's
                    pattern recognition ability to clearly identify the target
                    interaction and make an appointment faster
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4><li>Misclick rate</li></h4>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>A higher misclick rate suggests a more misleading elements</li>
                <li>The null hypothesis is that the rate at which users misclick is
                    the same on webpage A as it is on webpage B</li>
                <li>The alternative hypothesis is that the rate at which users 
                    misclick is more on webpage A than it is on webpage B</li>
                <li>I believe that the null hypotheses will be rejected because
                    webpage A has low color contrast in their buttons, which makes
                    it hard to read the text of the buttons. Furthermore, buttons of
                    different functionalities appear the same visually and exist in
                    the same column, which may mislead the user into thinking that
                    the different buttons do the same thing. 
                </li>
                <li>The reasoning for this alternative hypothesis is that
                    webpage B's increased color contrast, side-by-side button
                    layout, and differing button colors based on functionality
                    could aid the user's pattern recognition ability to clearly
                    identify the target interaction and reduce the chance of a
                    misclick.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4><li>Total distance of cursor movement</li></h4>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>A higher distance of cursor movement indicates that the user is going 
                    back and forth, which could mean that the webpage layout is difficult 
                    to navigate</li>
                <li>The null hypothesis is that the users move their cursors the 
                    same amount on webpage A as they do on webpage B</li>
                <li>The alternative hypothesis is that the users move their cursors
                    the more on webpage A than they do on webpage B</li>
                <li>I believe that the null hypotheses will be rejected because
                    webpage A has low color contrast in their buttons, their
                    appointments are not ordered by calendar, and buttons of
                    different functionalities appear the same. All of these 
                    reasons combined may cause the user to hover their cursors
                    over misleading buttons before completing the target interaction.
                </li>
                <li>The reasoning for this alternative hypothesis is that
                    webpage B's increased color contrast, ordering of appointments
                    by calendar, and side-by-side button layout, and differing
                    button colors that depend on functionality could aid the user's
                    pattern recognition ability to clearly identify the target
                    interaction and execute it without wasted cursor movement.

        <p>My main takeaway was that refining details for accessibility go a long way. Although work is meticulous, the result will look amazing, and I bet users with disabilities would love the improvmenets.</p>
